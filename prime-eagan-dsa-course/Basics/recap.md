- How fast does computation/memory grow?
    - Growth is respect to input, in languages like Go and JS, pay heavier penalties as memory can grow faster
    - Understand general trend with increase in input
    - Always considering worst case scenario, in example of iterating through string and performing function if certain string/number is found, then worst case if char doesn't exist or is at end of input

- Critical concepts:
    - growth is respect to input, drop constants, worst case = method of measurement
