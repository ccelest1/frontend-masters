## Actionable Steps
- [Learn Ts](./readme.md)
    - Understand concept of typing
    - Learning about TS combined with a popular fe framework like react
        * Questions to answer
            - Why are static types useful?
                * static types are useful because we are able to leave greater intent on a given coded file in order to mitigate ambiguity, as a result can turn errors in building from runtime to compile time (arguments are required to be followed)
            - What kind of problems do static types help catch with coding ?
                * aid with optimizing development (compile -> runtime)
                * detects values that may be potentially absent, breakage around contracts/constraints, non-finished refactoring
- After learning, practice by building a SPA that renders
    - understand ts compiler, how jsx gets converted to js, write code with typescript in react

- vite
    - code compressed -> sent to client via bundler
    - frontend frameworks: react, angular, svelte, vue.js
    - js bundlers: webpack, bable, vite
        * Responsible for transpilation, minification, bundling

- npm [ library, registry, and cli tool for js software packages ]
    - node package manager (npmjs.com)
    - has cli tools to install various packages, manage dependencies
        * upload frontend packages to registry

- create-x-app
    - create-react-app
        * frontend framework that utilizes js
    - create-vite-app
        * java script bundler (tool) -> enables spa creation via bundling of js files
        - easily sent to browser
        * __visit vitejs site__
            - learn about upstream docs
            - aux tools for building projects
            - hands on experience with desired framework of choice
    - __understand why__
        * ask why/how does page actively get rendered
        * TS -> Bundle understood by browser

- Need to be comfortable in regards to fullstack, setting up apps quickly
    - Theoretical
        * spin up sqlite server with a good understanding of chosen be (fastapi) -> clients are connected to each other via http -> define api, sever, client communicate
    - Docker
        * containers are instances of images, images contain app libraries, os template
        * create several containers from same image -> each container runs server declared by dockerfile
        * images are used as blueprints to create and run several containers

- Understand difference between node.js v browser runtime
    - import 'fs'
        * libs with nodejs that allow for read and write
        * node js running code vs browser running js code

- NodeJS [ custom js runtime ]
    * fxns to call in browser vs node fxns (backend js runtime)
    * Interpreter
        - cpu doesn't read js (js gets converted into machine language/binary)

## Career
- Begin career at startups
- [x] in resume include a tech stack section
    - clarified languages, frontend, backend, deployment, data
- cold contact recruiters following apps
    - Indeed.com -> filter to startups in local area
